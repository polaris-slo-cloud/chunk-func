# ChunkFunc Experiments

We have evaluated ChunkFunc in experiments with various real-world and synthetic workflows.
The source code of the serverless functions that comprise the real-world workflows is located in the [testbed](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/chunk-func/tree/master/testbed) folder.
We used the profiling results of these functions to design real-world and synthetic workflow scenarios for ChunkFunc to optimize.
They are located in the [ts/scenarios](https://github.com/polaris-slo-cloud/chunk-func/tree/master/ts/scenarios) folder.

The results of the latest execution of the experiments can be found [here](./2024-11-15).
